# Django_Weather_App

This is a very simple Weather application created by me while trying to learn more about Django.

I have used the following modules/wares:-

1. `Django` with built in `DataBase`.

2. `HTML` and `CSS` for designing the home page.

3. `json` loader for converting the json reponse from the server-side to python-parsable form.

4. `OpenWeatherAPIs` for getting access to the Weather, Humidity, Latitudinal, Longitudinal data.

*This is a raw app, and needs a lot of modifications to be done.*
